## FAQ

### Why 2?
The original Tiny Games is a mess and I don't wanna talk about it (source code is [here](https://github.com/c0mplexity0/tiny-games)). This is simply tiny-games-2 for the sake of differentiating it, you can just call it Tiny Games since that's how it's referred to everywhere else.

Note to Adam: Please for God's sake fix the issue where you have to build the project in full before running the dev command.
